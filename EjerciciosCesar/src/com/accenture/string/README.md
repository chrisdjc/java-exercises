- Test class:
  Given the original code, it was needed to override one method to get the output 'FALSE, TRUE'
- TestMyDate class:
  We had to weite the missing code, and override the equals method in MyDate class, so that it can compare that when two MyDate objects have the same year, month and day, the result is true, otherwise false. The expected output is: 'm1!=m2, m1 is equal to m2, m3 is not equal to m1 or m2'
